      <h2>Bitcoin: The First Cryptocurrency</h2>
      <div><img src="./bit.png.webp" alt=""></div>
      <p>Satoshi Nakamoto launched Bitcoin in January 2009. It is the most popular cryptocurrency. Bitcoin operates as a peer-to-peer blockchain without intermediaries.</p>
      <table class="pros-cons">
        <tr>
          <th>Pros</th>
          <th>Cons</th>
        </tr>

      <h3>Advantages of Bitcoin</h3>
      <p><strong>Security:</strong> Bitcoin has a decentralized network and cryptographic principles. It provides excellent protection against censorship and fraud.</p>
      <p><strong>Established Market and High Liquidity:</strong> Bitcoin has a well-established market and is easy to purchase and sell on major exchanges, such as Fidelity and Binance. The market valuation of Bitcoin is almost $1,491 billion in April 2025. For traders, this liquidity is a huge benefit.</p>
      <p><strong>Decentralization:</strong> By doing away with third-party middlemen, decentralization lowers the risks connected to centralized financial institutions and eliminates single points of failure (Investopedia). The philosophy of financial independence is in line with this.</p>
      <h3>Disadvantages of Bitcoin</h3>
      <p><strong>Scalability Issues:</strong> With processing times averaging 10 minutes, 1 MB of block size limit leads to slower transaction speeds and increased fees during strong usage periods. This restricts how it can be used for everyday transactions.</p>
      <p><strong>Volatility:</strong> From November 2021 to November 2022, the price of Bitcoin dropped by almost 80%, and it fluctuates by up to 5% per day. It is riskier for investors looking for steadiness.</p>
      <p><strong>Security and Regulatory Risks:</strong> Although the blockchain is safe, wallets and exchanges have been compromised. According to Chainanalysis (2023), $3.8 billion was stolen in 2022, and regulatory ambiguity remains.</p>

      <h2>Ether: The Second Biggest Cryptocurrency</h2>
      <div><img src="./Ether.jpeg" alt=""></div>
      <p>Ether (ETH) as the fuel that powers the Ethereum blockchain, it can be used to pay transaction fees and computational services on the network. Ethereum, a decentralized, open-source blockchain platform founded in July 2015 by Vitalik Buterin and a group of co-founders, has completely changed the cryptocurrency landscape with its groundbreaking smart contract capability.</p>
      <table class="pros-cons">
        <tr>
          <th>Pros</th>
          <th>Cons</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>1. Passive Income</td>
          <td>1. High Transaction Cost</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>2. Environmental Sustainability</td>
          <td>2. Complexity for User</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td></td>
          <td>3. Uncertainty of Regulation</td>
        </tr>

      <h3>Advantages of Ether</h3>
      <p><strong>Utility in Smart Contracts and Dapps:</strong> Ether is the gas to pay the transaction fee to implement smart contracts. Those smart contracts will self-execute to power a decentralized finance platform, a non-fungible token as known as NFT.</p>
      <p><strong>Passive Income:</strong> Depending on network participation, Ether holders can secure the network and earn rewards by staking Ether. Staking Ether offers a passive income stream for investors.</p>
      <p><strong>Environmental Sustainability:</strong> The proof of stake (POS) mechanism reduced electricity 99% of energy consumption. On the other hand, its carbon footprint decreased by almost 99.99%. The mechanism attracts investors who are eco-conscious.</p>
      <h3>Disadvantages of Ether</h3>
      <p><strong>High Transaction Cost:</strong> During network congestion, Ether transaction demands a high amount of gas fees, especially. Complex transactions like NFT minting and DeFi require exceeding $2 - $10 gas fees in 2025. Other chains like Solana require near-zero fees. High fees harm Ethereum’s scalability.</p>
      <p><strong>Complexity for User:</strong> The condition of using Ether is to understand wallets, private keys, and gas fees. These requirements are a barrier for non-technical users. There are incidents of incorrect gas limits or losing wallet’s private key. 40% of new crypto users cited complexity as the barrier to using Ethereum.</p>
      <p><strong>Uncertainty of Regulation:</strong> Ether faces regular inspection in the US. DeFi and NFT innovation may be stifled by the EU's MiCA regulation. It complies requirements to Ethereum-based enterprises. Therefore, those regulations restrict Ether's expansion and raise operating expenses.</p>

      <h2>Our Discovery and Thoughts</h2>
      <div><img class="img-bitdown"src="./bitdown.png" alt=""></div>
      <p>In our perspective, Bitcoin and Ether chart a unique course in the digital industry. Nevertheless, they also have significant drawbacks. Bitcoin possesses extreme volatility, and the public starts to see it as a speculative asset rather than a reliable medium of exchange. The proof of work mechanism consumes huge amounts of energy, raising critical environmental concerns.</p>
      <p>We believe investing in cryptocurrencies should involve sufficient consideration due to their unpredictable nature. Unlike stocks or bonds, their value hinges heavily on market sentiment, this power can inflate the price today and crash them tomorrow, leading to investors facing sudden loss.</p>
