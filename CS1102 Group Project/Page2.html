      <h2>How Blockchain Works</h2>
      <ul>
        <g><p><li>Blockchain is a decentralized and distributed ledger technology while it is not just about cryptocurrency. It also be used in different sectors like finance, supply chains and healthcare.</li> </p></g>
        <g><p><li>Every node has a private key, and it would be used to sign the transaction. Once a user initiated a transaction, the signed transaction would group into a block and broadcast to every node in the network, recording down the value transferred from one address to another.  </li></p></g>
        <g><p><li>Miners or validators are the people who grouping transactions into a block. They would use a consensus mechanism like Proof-of-Work (PoW) or Proof-of-Stake (PoS) to validate the transactions. Take PoW as the example, miners need to solve complex cryptographic puzzles, finding a nonce to meet a hash difficulty target. Miner who first to solve the puzzle and adds to the blockchain can earn rewards. </li></p></g>
        <g><p><li>Once the new block adds to the chain, all nodes update their copies as each block includes the hash of the previous block. Therefore, altering a block would require modifying all subsequent blocks. It is a computationally infeasible task which ensures the immutability of the records. </li></p></g>
