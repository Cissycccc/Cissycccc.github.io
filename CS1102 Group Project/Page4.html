        <li>Verification: By reviewing the sender's balance and assuring the transaction adheres to the network's rules, miners verify the transaction.</li>
        <li>Inclusion in a Block: The transaction will included in a block and combined to the blockchain, leading it to change to permanent and immutable when it is verified.</li>
        <li>Completion: When the transaction is confirmed, the recipient wallet reflects the received amount.</li>
